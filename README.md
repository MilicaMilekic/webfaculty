# webfaculty
Development of a web application that monitors changes of grades, student and professor
information on a faculty.
Specification:
 This application contains a login page, which differs when a student, professor, or the
admin logs in.
 When students log in, they can see their grades and information about professors.
 When professors log in, they can see the grades of all students and have the ability to
enter grades.
 When the admin logs in, his page view contains information about all the students
and the professors, and he has the ability to update, delete, and add grades, students,
and professors.
Technologies I used for this project are:
-MySQL for the database
-Java Server Pages
