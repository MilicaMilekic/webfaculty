# webfaculty
Development of a web application that monitors faculty changes of grades, students and professors
This application contains a login page, which differs when a student, professor or an admin logs on
When a student logs in he can see his grades, and information about his professors
When a professor logs in he can see grades of all students, inormation about all the professors and he has the ability to add grades
When an admin logs in he has the ability to add,delete and update grades,students and professors
Technologies I used for this project are:
-MySQL for database
-Java Server Pages
-GlassFish Server
-HTML and CSS(Bootstrap navbar)
-AJAX
